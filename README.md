# ReverseCheck v1.0
This is a quick project I made in about 2 hours. It checks to see if a number you type is evenly divisible by/into its palindrome (Is 321 evenly divisble by 123?). Just download the file, run it, and type a number. Type -1 to quit. I have yet to implement handling when a user types in a number that begins in zeros (Is 0015 divisible into 5100?).
